If you're interested in a dictionary that converts English text to IPA, the file
data/word_to_ipa.csv is what you're looking for.

--------

The International Phonetic Alphabet gives a pronunciation for any word. But I couldn't
find Python projects that let me convert from English text to the IPA.

There is one major pronouncing dictionary -- the CMU Pronouncing dictionary, available at
http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict . But I read that there was a bigger dictionary,
called the Moby Project, by Grady Ward. Copies of the Moby Project were available at
https://github.com/Hyneman/moby-project . I chose that as my base.

The Moby Project's files were badly documented, and the files were slightly corrupt. I've
fixed them, as best I could, in this version of the project.

Please let me know about any mistakes in this dictionary!
